==========

A complete Event system for minecraft.
* Comes default with several Match and Event Types
* Huge amounts of customization through the configs and in game commands
* Framework and API for easily creating custom matches/events.

Reporting Issues:
---------
We have had problems with bug reports that lack sufficient information.


The problem is that people aren't giving us enough information to 
replicate bugs. If we cannot identify exactly under what conditions 
a bug is present, then it becomes harder to fix. 


Please, if you report a bug, provide ample information about your situation. 


If you need an answer in a timely manner, pleasr contact Zach or Europia via Skype: 

Zach's Skype: zach_443

Europia79's Skype: Nicodemis79


The reason for this, is because in a Skype call, we can share screens, 
where we can see your entire setup, and ask you to verify parts of your setup 
(like your config files, etc), and overall it just makes things easier. 


We really appreciate when you report bugs, and we would like you to report them to us whenever you find them.
However please be mindful of the information that you give us and/or how you contact us. If you really have no 
idea where to start, maybe a 1 on 1 conversation on Skype. If you know exactly how to replicate your problem, or 
you have a good amount of information about it, creating a new issue might be a better solution:

---------
* Arena : You fight with what is given to you in the config. You can't bring items in or out.
