==========

A complete Event system for minecraft.
* Comes default with several Match and Event Types
* Huge amounts of customization through the configs and in game commands
* Framework and API for easily creating custom matches/events.

Reporting Issues:
---------
We have had problems with people opening new github tickets at
* https://github.com/Zach443/BattleArena/issues
* https://github.com/Zach443/BattleArena/issues/new


The problem is that people aren't giving us enough information to 
replicate bugs. If we cannot identify exactly under what conditions 
a bug is present, then it becomes harder to fix.


Henceforth, any bugs should be reported directly to me via Skype: 
My username is Nicodemis79.


The reason for this, is because in a Skype call, we can share screens, 
where I can see your entire setup, and ask you to verify parts of your setup, 
like your config files, etc. 


This will allow me to quickly identify the problem. And also, you won't have 
to waste time filling out detailed bug reports with information that may 
or may not be relevant. It will save time for both of us. Thank you!

Default Match Types:
---------
* Arena : You fight with what is given to you in the config. You can't bring items in or out.
* Skirmish : You bring in what you want to fight with, you take out whatever you pick up.
* Colloseum : 4 teams against each other, last man standing wins.
* BattleGround : 1 minute match where the winner is the one with the highest kills after 1 minute. 4 teams of 1 player each compete.

Default Event Types:
---------
* Free For All : last player/team left standing wins 
* DeathMatch : 2 minute event where if you die you respawn. Highest kills wins
* Tournament : ( bracket tournament for any number of teams )
