#### Events vs Matches
### Events
## Events can have "open" phases were people are joining but the event hasnt started
## They also can have multiple "matches" that occur as part of the event (like a tournament, where 
## each match is part of the whole 'Tournament Event')
## Some Events like the FreeForAll only have 1 match, but still have the open phase that lasts until someone starts it
### Match
## a single battle between teams
